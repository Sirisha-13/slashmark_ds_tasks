BASIC Projects:
Task 1 : Analyze Daily Weather Data :Use a small dataset of daily weather information (temperature, precipitation, etc.)
Reference Dataset: You can find sample weather datasets on websites like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Task 2 : Fake News Detection: Combat the spread of fake news using Python, TfidfVectorizer, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier. This project helps verify the legitimacy of information and prevents the harmful effects of misinformation in the digital age.
Task 3 : Gender & Age Prediction : Use ML and Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV to analyze photos and predict age and gender, overcoming challenges like cosmetics and lighting.
INTERMEDIATE Projects:
Task 1 : Customer Churn Prediction for a Subscription Service : Use a dataset that includes customer demographics, usage data, and whether the customer churned or not. Employ machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can identify customers likely to churn.
Task 2 : Diabetic Retinopathy Screening: Develop an automated system using neural networks to screen for diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in diabetic patients. The system analyzes retinal photographs to determine the presence of retinopathy.
ADVANCED Project:
Final Task Forest Fire Detection using CNN : Leverage Convolutional Neural Networks to develop an efficient system for early forest fire detection. This technology helps protect natural resources and prevent wildfires.
